# Traffic Density Estimation | OpenCV

## Course Project COP290, Spring 2021

---

This project has three parts:

1. **Part I:** This part involves image processing using OpenCV. This includes finding homography, changing perspective and cropping. 
2. **Part II:** This part involves video processing using OpenCV. In addition to Part I, this includes background subtraction, optical flow, and image processing techniques like Gaussian blur, erode, dilate etc. 
3. **Part III:** This part involves analyzing Utility vs Runtime trade-offs in our traffic density estimator. We employ various methods such as frame-dropping, resolution-change, spatial and temporal multi-threading.
